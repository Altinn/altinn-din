DIN 1451 is a sans-serif typeface that is widely used for traffic,
administrative and technical applications. It was defined by the German
standards body DIN - Deutsches Institut fur Normung (German Institute for
Standardization) in the standard sheet DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces) in
1931. Similar standards existed for stencilled letters.

Originally designed for industrial uses, the first DIN-type fonts were a
simplified design that could be applied with limited technical difficulty.
Due to the design's legibility and uncomplicated, unadorned design, it has
become popular for general purpose use in signage and display adaptations.
Many adaptations and expansions of the original design have been released
digitally.

Datto uses a DIN-font as primary corporate font and commissioned Monotype to
create several styles, for internal use and to be open sourced under a SIL
OFL v1.1 license.

Altinn changed the reserved font names from D-DIN to Altinn-DIN
to be able to do modifications, as required by the SIL OFL v1.1 license.

Altinn-DIN currently provides the following Unicode coverage:
Basic Latin: complete
Latin-1 Supplement: complete
Plus ISO 8859-15 characters missing in the above.
